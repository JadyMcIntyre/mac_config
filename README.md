# Jady's MacBook Configurations  
A repository for all my macOS configuration settings and tools. This includes **zsh functions**, **zshrc**, and **Neovim setup**.

## 📁 **Zsh Functions**  
Your custom zsh functions are located in:  
`~/.zsh/functions`

### ⚙️ Ensure Proper Permissions  
Make sure the functions are readable by running:  
```bash
chmod +r ~/.zsh/functions/*.zsh
```
